# applied-stats-byu-2026

Workshop materials for the **50th Summer Institute of Applied Statistics (SIAS)** at Brigham Young University, 17-18 June 2026, taught by Julia Silge. Title: *Programming with LLMs for Data Practitioners*. Two days:

- Day 1, "Build on AI": programming with LLMs from R (`ellmer`) and Python (`chatlas`); prompts, structured output, tool calling, RAG, Shiny chat.
- Day 2, "Build with AI": using AI coding assistants (inline completions, chat, agentic). Currently mostly TODO placeholders.

## Layout

- `index.qmd`: landing page with welcome, learning objectives, local-setup prep, and a per-day schedule table.
- `slides/`: eight numbered reveal.js decks (`01-talking-with-llms.qmd` ... `08-agentic-workflows.qmd`) plus `custom.scss` and `title-slide.html` (custom partial).
- `code/`: flat `NN-name.R` / `NN-name.py` exercise skeletons (18 exercises, R + Python pairs).
- `images/`: 8 unDraw SVG illustrations, one per deck. Mapping is fixed; see deck YAML `data-background-image`.
- `_extensions/`: `gadenbuie/countdown` (timer shortcode) and `quarto-ext/fontawesome`.
- `_quarto.yml`: website config; theme is `[zephyr, footer.scss]`. Output dir is `docs/`.
- `footer.scss`: site SCSS. Disables zephyr's Google Fonts import via `$web-font-path: false`, plus footer layout and table-width rules.
- `init-env.sh`: local setup helper for R (renv) + Python (uv). No Codespaces.
- `requirements.txt`: Python packages (`chatlas`, `shiny`, plus deps).
- Renamed `footer.scss` from `footer.css` because it contains SCSS (`$var` syntax). Do not rename back, the CSS linter will complain.

## Slide deck conventions

Every deck's YAML uses:

```yaml
format:
  revealjs:
    theme: [default, custom.scss]
    template-partials:
      - title-slide.html
    title-slide-attributes:
      data-background-image: "../images/undraw_<name>.svg"
      data-background-size: "auto NN%"      # tuned per illustration aspect ratio
      data-background-position: "82% 85%"   # uniform across all decks
      data-background-repeat: "no-repeat"
```

- **`title-slide.html`** is a custom Pandoc partial that wraps title / subtitle / author in `<div class="title-slide-inner">` so `custom.scss` can pin it to the top-left.
- **H1 section dividers** repeat the illustration via inline attributes: `# Heading {background-image="..." background-size="..." background-position="..." background-repeat="..."}`. Size and position must match that deck's title slide values.
- **Title and Thanks slides have no `{background-image=...}` attribute** so they show plain (no corner illustration).
- **`# Thanks!` slide** at the end of every deck repeats the contact card from deck 01's `# Hello!` slide, with undraw attribution in `::: footer :::`.

### Activity pattern ("Your turn")

Every place participants do hands-on work uses:

```markdown
## Your turn

::: {.callout-note icon=false}

## Activity

<description, optionally a lead-in plus bullets>
:::

{{< countdown minutes=N >}}
```

The `{{< countdown >}}` shortcode comes from the `gadenbuie/countdown` extension in `_extensions/`.

### Per-deck illustration mapping

| Deck | Illustration | `data-background-size` |
|---|---|---|
| 01 Talking with LLMs | `undraw_chat-with-ai_ir62.svg` | `auto 50%` |
| 02 Programming with LLMs | `undraw_large-language-models_m4no.svg` | `auto 45%` |
| 03 Augmented generation | `undraw_ai-research-assistant_cxx0.svg` | `auto 50%` |
| 04 Beyond tools | `undraw_artificial-intelligence_43qa.svg` | `auto 55%` |
| 05 AI coding assistants | `undraw_coding-assistant_i178.svg` | `auto 40%` |
| 06 Code completions | `undraw_vibe-coding_mjme.svg` | `auto 50%` |
| 07 Chat assistance | `undraw_ai-answers_uxgx.svg` | `auto 50%` |
| 08 Agentic workflows | `undraw_ai-agent_pdkp.svg` | `auto 45%` |

Position is `82% 85%` everywhere. The size varies because the illustrations have different aspect ratios; within a deck, the title slide and all H1 section dividers use the same values.

The index hero is `undraw_vibe-coding_mjme.svg` (shared with deck 06).

## Styling

- Site (HTML pages) uses the `zephyr` Bootswatch theme. Default zephyr colors; no custom palette right now.
- Slides use reveal.js's `default` theme + `slides/custom.scss`. The SCSS is intentionally minimal: just the title-slide layout and section-divider positioning.
- Title slide: title block pinned to the top-left via a `.title-slide-inner` wrapper (custom partial + absolute positioning). Reveal's centering is overridden with `top: 0 !important; height: 100% !important` on `#title-slide`.
- Section divider slides (any `<section>` with an H1 as a direct child) get the same centering override plus `margin-top: 5%` on the H1. The `:has()` selector keeps the rule from affecting the title slide (whose H1 is inside `.title-slide-inner`).

## Available skills

- `.claude/skills/workshop-time-estimate/SKILL.md`: estimates total workshop time by summing countdowns and counting non-exercise slides, then comparing against the schedule table in `index.qmd`. Trigger by asking about time budget or whether there's enough content.

## Operating notes

- `quarto preview` is typically started by Julia in a separate terminal, not by Claude. Wiping `docs/` and `.quarto/` is the right move when stale builds cause weirdness (e.g., old font imports lingering after SCSS changes).
- Local-only workflow: there is no `.devcontainer/` and no Codespaces wiring on purpose.
- The repo is not git-initialized yet. Holding off on commits until Julia is ready.

## Per-user preferences

- No em dashes in any file content, commit messages, or PR text (shareable artifacts). Use commas, semicolons, parens, or two sentences. En dashes and hyphens are fine.
- Julia prefers iterating in small steps with previews; do not make large structural changes without checking in first.
