# Slide 01: Talking with LLMs via code (Anatomy of a conversation)
# Goal: play a word guessing game where the LLM is the guesser. The first user
# message includes a modifier (e.g. "In British English,") that steers later
# turns; this shows how the conversation carries state in the message history.
